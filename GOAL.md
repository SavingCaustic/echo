# Project Goal

  * Have fun building the FE, the synths and effects.

  * Have a diminished version being launched on GPlay during 2024.


## Planned improvements

  * Master tune

  * More time-signatures

  * Better LFO

  * Real-time audio-in processor

  * Improved playability on subtractive synth

## Skipping

  * Many castic synths won't be converted

  * FE won't be as fluid as old Caustic.
