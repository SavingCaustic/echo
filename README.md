# echo
DSP breadboarding using PHP

## Main objective
Preparing structure for upcoming C-project

## Requirements
To run project, have a PHP-cli installation, > PHP8.

* Test scripts are run from console
* The web-based synth-previewer works best by starting the built in server like:

 ~/echo/www # php -S 127.0.0.1:8080

## Remember
* Currently, everything is subject to change.
* Don't work. Have fun with it. :)
